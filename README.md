# **SQL Project: Hospital Management System**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates my expertise in **SQL** by implementing a **Hospital Management System** to analyze and manage data related to doctors, patients, appointments, medical procedures, and billing. The project focuses on querying, organizing, and extracting valuable insights from relational data.  
The datasets were downloaded from **Kaggle**.

---

## **Datasets**

The project uses the following tables:

- **`doctor`**  
  Contains information about doctors, including their **ID**, **name**, **specialization**, and **contact details**.  

- **`Medical_procedure`**  
  Stores details of various **medical procedures** and their associated **appointments**.  

- **`Patient`**  
  Contains patient details such as **ID**, **name**, and **contact information**.  

- **`appointment`**  
  Tracks **appointments** between doctors and patients.  

- **`billing`**  
  Manages **invoices** related to patient treatments.  

---

## **Key Features**

This project includes a variety of **SQL operations** and queries to answer business-relevant questions, including:

### **Basic Data Manipulation**
- **Creating tables**, **modifying schemas**, and **loading data** from CSV files.  
- **Updating** and **concatenating data** to improve table consistency.

### **Insights and Analysis**
- **Doctors and Specialization**: Retrieve a list of all **doctors** and their **specializations**.  
- **Appointments**: Identify all **appointments** for a specific **doctor** or **patient**.  
- **Procedures**: List all **medical procedures** and analyze their assignments.

### **Advanced SQL Queries**
- **Joins and Aggregations**:  
  - Combine **patient**, **appointment**, and **procedure data** to find patients undergoing specific treatments (e.g., **Kidney Transplant**).  
  - Count the number of **appointments** for each doctor.  

- **Ranking and Window Functions**:  
  - Rank doctors based on the number of **procedures performed**.  
  - Find the most recent **appointment** for each patient.  

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL  
- **Data Loading**: SQL **`COPY`** command to import data from CSV files.  
- **SQL Features**:  
  - **DDL** (Data Definition Language)  
  - **DML** (Data Manipulation Language)  
  - **Joins**, **aggregations**, **subqueries**, and **window functions**.
